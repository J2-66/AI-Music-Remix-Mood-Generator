# AI-Music-Remix-Mood-Generator
AI-powered web application that generates mood-based music and allows intelligent remixing of uploaded songs using pitch shifting, tempo modification, and audio filtering techniques.
##🎵 AI Music Remix & Mood Generator

An AI-powered web application that allows users to:

-🎶 Generate music based on mood

 -🎧 Remix uploaded songs using AI-based audio transformations

 -📥 Download generated and remixed music

This project is built using Python, Streamlit, and Digital Signal Processing techniques.

 # 📌 Project Objective
 
Remixing or creating music typically requires professional tools and technical expertise. This project provides a simple and interactive platform where students can:

•	Generate music based on emotional moods

•	Apply AI-based remix transformations

•	Explore creative expression without advanced technical knowledge


# 🚀 Features

🎼 Mood-Based Music Generator

•	Happy
